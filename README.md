# Episode 2: A Cross-Platform Navigation Controller

When developing cross-platform applications in Titanium, one of the challenges facing a developer is maximizing code reuse while still 
conforming to the UI conventions of the Android or iOS platform.  In this weekâ€™s episode, we explore how we could create a hierarchical 
Navigation Controller, which would display a series of windows in an easily navigable stack.  Be sure to join us next week as well, when 
further explore how to extend core Titanium UI components to create custom UI controls.
